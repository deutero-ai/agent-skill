# Creating a Deutero account as an agent

For an agent with a browser tool and a programmable inbox. Verified end to end against production on 17 September 2026 using an AgentMail inbox and headless Chromium.

If a human is signing up, none of this is needed: send them to `https://dashboard.deutero.ai/login`.

## What you need

- **A programmable inbox you can read.** AgentMail, or any IMAP/API mailbox. Deutero sends a magic link there. Use a dedicated inbox per account so links from different runs cannot collide.
- **A browser you can drive.** There is no account-creation endpoint. Once the account exists, everything else can go over MCP or REST.
- **Cookies that persist across the whole flow.** The intermediate login state is a session cookie. If the browser restarts mid-flow, you start again from step 1.

Steps 1–4 must run in one browser session.

## Step 1 — Request the magic link

Load `https://dashboard.deutero.ai/login`, fill `#email-input` with the inbox address, click **Continue with email**. The page then reads "An email was sent to …".

## Step 2 — Read the email

Wait for mail from `login@stytch.com`, subject **"Your login request to Deutero"**. Take the link from the **plain-text** body:

```
https://stytch.com/v1/magic_links/redirect?public_token=…&stytch_token_type=discovery&token=…
```

Two traps, both of which produce confusing errors:

- The HTML body escapes `&` as `&amp;`. Using it unmodified produces `invalid_public_token_id`.
- Each new request invalidates the previous link. Always use the newest message.

## Step 3 — Authenticate

Extract the `token` query parameter and navigate directly to:

```
https://dashboard.deutero.ai/authenticate?stytch_token_type=discovery&token=<token>
```

This is the same destination the email button eventually reaches, and it is the more reliable path for a headless browser: following `stytch.com/v1/magic_links/redirect` in headless Chromium landed on `stytch.com/redirect-error` in testing, while the direct call worked every time.

You are redirected to `/create-organization` (new address) or straight to the dashboard (address already known).

## Step 4 — Create the organization

On `/create-organization`, fill **Organization Name** and submit:

```python
page.get_by_label("Organization Name").fill("<name>")
page.get_by_role("button", name="Create Organization").click()
```

You land on `/onboarding`. The organization starts on the Hobby plan with 15 credits. The slug is derived from the email domain unless you set one.

## Step 5 — Get an API key

1. Go to `https://dashboard.deutero.ai/settings`.
2. Fill `#apiKeyName` with a label — the id is `apiKeyName`, not something like `apiKeyLabel`.
3. Click **Generate API Key**.
4. Read the key from `#newApiKey` in the dialog, or from the JSON response of `POST /settings/api/keys`. **It is shown once.**

Store it as `DEUTERO_API_KEY` with owner-only file permissions. Never log it.

## Step 6 — Switch to the API

Drive the UI no further than you have to; MCP and REST are faster and steadier.

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

client = Client(StreamableHttpTransport(
    "https://dashboard.deutero.ai/mcp",
    headers={"X-API-Key": key},
))
```

Verify with `health_health_get`, then `list_projects`.

## Session notes for any later browser work

- Sign-in survives browser restarts for about 7 days, but **the selected project and study do not** — those live in the Flask session. Re-select with `/select-project?projectId=<id>`, or pass `?survey_id=<id>` on each study page, which every study page accepts.
- A redirect to `/login` means the session lapsed: redo steps 1–3. Build that in as an automatic retry rather than treating it as a failure.
- Several pages **lazy-load on scroll**, the Responses dashboard especially. If a number reads "Loading…", scroll before concluding anything is broken.

## What a fresh agent account cannot do

A new account lands on **Hobby**, which is text chat interviews on the open-weights model and nothing else:

- Run simulations, author an Interview Flow, ask image-upload questions, use voice or video, use the standard or premium model tiers, keep more than one study open at a time, or exceed 15 credits a month. All of that needs a paid plan, and upgrading needs a human to complete Stripe checkout.
- Generate study details, questions or welcome text through the API — those generators are dashboard-only. Write the text yourself instead.

`plan-limits.md` has the full matrix and the fallback for each gate.

## Courtesies

- Prefer simulations to real participant interviews when you only need test data — and remember simulations need a paid plan, so on Hobby the honest test is one short interview you take yourself.
- Never post a live recruitment link into a real channel from a test account.
- Disable or delete API keys you no longer use.
